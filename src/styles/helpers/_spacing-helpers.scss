// This .scss loop will create "margin helpers" and "padding.
// It will generate several classes such as:

// .m-r-10 which gives margin-right 10 pixels.
// .m-r-15 gives MARGIN to the RIGHT 15 pixels.
// .m-t-15 gives MARGIN to the TOP 15 pixels and so on.

// .p-b-5 gives PADDING to the BOTTOM of 5 pixels
// .p-l-40 gives PADDING to the LEFT of 40 pixels

// The first letter is "m" or "p" for MARGIN or PADDING
// Second letter is "t", "b", "l", or "r" for TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, or RIGHT
// Third letter is the number of spacing in pixels. Adjust the amounts generated by editing the $spaceamounts variable below.

$spaceamounts: (
  0,
  5,
  10,
  15,
  20,
  25,
  30,
  35,
  40,
  45,
  50,
  75,
  100
); // Adjust this to include the pixel amounts you need.
$sides: (top, bottom, left, right); // Leave this variable alone

@each $space in $spaceamounts {
  @each $side in $sides {
    .m-#{str-slice($side, 0, 1)}-#{$space} {
      margin-#{$side}: #{$space}px !important;
    }

    .p-#{str-slice($side, 0, 1)}-#{$space} {
      padding-#{$side}: #{$space}px !important;
    }
  }
}

.p-0 {
  padding: 0 !important;
